# Updating the WIX Lab Website
The Lab has a public website that is targeted to both patients and potential participants who may be interested in participating in our studies as well as fellow researchers and potential collaborators. The site was created usign WIX, and will need to be periodically updated to reflect the correct staff and protocols, as well as to reflect new publications and news items that might be intersting to visitors. This guide will provide some basic information about updating the page so you can keep it running smoothly. 

## Editing WIX
You will need to get the login info to the WIX editor from Prof. Baller. WIX, luckily, is a very intuitive website builder and has an easy-to-use GUI that makes updating simple.

There are several pages in the website:

| Site Page | Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Home | Quickly introduces the lab. Contains brief updates and links to other pages |
| Team | Presents PI, staff, and collaborators |
| Research | Meant to be accessible to both patients and researchers. Links to more specific pages |
| Publications | Highlights select publications |
| For Patients | Patient targeted. Accessible language outlines our research goals and offers deeper explanations |
| News | Big events we want to showcase to website visitors! |

The pages that will need to be most frequently updated are `News`, `Publications`, and `Home`. 

## Updating `News`
The `News` tab should be kept as up-to-date as possible. Whenever Dr. Baller has a new paper published, gives an exciting talk, or recieves an award, the `News` page should be updated to reflect this accomplishment. Luckily, this page was created using a 'Repeater', which will allow you to add more identical items to the page very easily. You will click on one of the items through the editor, and select the button `Manage Items`. This will open a toolbar on the right. By clicking the three dots on the right you can duplicate any item to easily create a new news item and toggle the order.  Make sure to add a title, image, description, and to add a link to the button so that interested visitors can learn more. 

## Updating `Publications`
The `Publications` tab should also be updated any time a new preprint is released. These icons are also created with a 'Repeater', but are slightly more complex. These repeaters include a main image and a hover function, allowing them to provide the reader with more information when they move the mouse over the icon. When you add a new repeater, make sure to put a description/publication abstract and pubmed link on the hover side and an image and the title on the main side. You can change the colors as needed. The image should be taken from the paper in question. 

## Updating `Grants`
`Grants` is a subpage of `Research`, and will need to be updated to reflect all of the grants that Dr. Baller has received for lab research. This repeater is very similar to the `Publications` repeater. It requires an image and title on the front and a description and link to the grant site on the hover side. 

## Updating `Home`
Home has a little news section that gives a preview of the most recent, exciting stuff happening in the lab! Therfore, whenever another page is updated to reflect a new hire, publication, grant, award, etc., it should be reflected in the `Home` news section. You can add new items using the repeater toggle, or you can replace the informatio on an existing item to keep the news fresh and to limit the number of items on the front page. 

## Recruitment on the Website
An exciting idea we had was to, at some point in the future, but recruitment information for patients and possible an interest form on the site (likely through the `For Patients`page). However, before this can be implemented, everything must be IRB approved.
