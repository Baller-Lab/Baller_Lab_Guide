# Recruiting Study Participants

Study participants are recruited from the Penn MS Center, located on the second floor Neurology Clinic in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine or at Pennsylvania Hospital. Participants may be referred by their MS specialist or contacted from prior participation in PennSIVE research studies. There may also be new modes of recruitment implemented in the future. Currently (as of 11/28/23) the following IRB-approved recruitment scripts can be used in participant communication. Note that eligible participants must have had recent routine clinical imaging done at a PI-approved Penn imaging center.

Be aware that, when you schedule a participant for a visit, Dr. Baller or another clinician must be notified and agree to be on call for that two to three hour block of time. It is best to discuss on-call best practices with Dr. Baller before recruiting and to remind your on-call clinician 24 hours before the interview. 

## Recruitment Practices in the MS Clinic

***General Recruitment Strategy***
1. Our lab partners with Neurology and we recruit directly from the MS clinics.
2. Weekly, you should pre-screen the PennChart schedules for a group of the MS providers that are involved in study recruitment for patients that meet our study criteria.
3. Once you create a list of patients that fit our criteria, send the providers a message via PennChart with the patients’ information (name or MRN and day/time of appointment).
4. For a subset of providers, we attend clinic to directly recruit during a participant’s appointment.
5. We may also receive direct referrals via PennChart from MS providers or CRCs.

***Recruitment Criteria***

When reviewing possible participants charts in PennChart, there are certain criteria to look out for that may make someone more suitable for the study:
1. Check that their most recent MRI clinical scans are from a Penn affiliated hospital (this is a requirement, see below for more information).
2. The most recent MRI clinical scans of the brain must be from the “MR Head MS Post Processing W/WO IV Contrast” Protocol (this is listed in PennChart under imaging tab).
3. A recent MS diagnosis (this is preferred, but not a requirement).
4. Low to moderate lesion burden: This is not a requirement but can be helpful if you need to shorten your list of possible participants. If there is extremely high lesion burden, ask Dr. Baller to review whether to pursue.
5. Part of the Ocrevus de-escalation research protocol.
6. Part of Dr. Schindler’s 7T protocol: If they are a part of this protocol, you can ignore screening for a lower lesion load.
7. Part of an underrepresented group in research. The NIH requires recruitment targets specifically for Black and Hispanic patients. 

* Current Penn affiliated hospitals: Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP), Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC), Penn Neurology Cherry Hill (CHNMP), Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine (PCAM), Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH), Penn Medicine Radnor (RADK), and Penn Pain Medicine Center Tuttleman Center (TTLMN). If there is an additional hospital that you are unsure is a Penn affiliated hospital, you can go to [Uniview](https://pennmedaccess.uphs.upenn.edu/vdesk/webtop.eui?webtop=/Common/webtop_modern_prod&webtop_type=webtop_full) within the PennMedicine Remote Access Portal. Here, type in the participants first and last name and then click on the appropriate profile (you should reference their birthdays from PennChart to ensure that you are choosing the right person). Navigate to the documents tab, which can be found in the top left corner, and then click on the most recent “MR HEAD MS POST PROCESSING WO IV CONTRAST” scans. Underneath the word “Examination”, you will see where the images were taken. As long as it does ***not*** say “OSF”, you will know that the scans were taken at a Penn affiliated hospital. 

***Recruitment Specifics by Provider Type***

Matt Schindler
1. Dr. Schindler sees patients at PCAM on ***Thursday mornings***, typically from ***8am to 12pm***, and Pennsylvania Hospital (on 9th and Pine) from 8am to 12pm.
2. After prescreening his patients for the week and sending him a message via PennChart of which clinic you would like to shadow, you may attend clinic and join him during his appointments. During the end of the appointments, Dr. Schindler will introduce you and allow you to give the patient a spiel about the study. If the patient indicates that they are interested in participating, ask them for their preferred method of contact, and then follow up with them within 24-48 hours of first contact. 

Chris Perrone
1. Dr. Perrone sees patients at PCAM on ***Thursday*** mornings, typically from ***8am to 12pm***.
2. The same process that was done for Dr. Schindler should be applied to Dr. Perrone’s patients as well. On Thursday clinics, you can go back and forth between Dr. Perrone’s and Dr. Schindler’s patients depending on who best fits the criteria. Follow the same process listed above if the patient indicates that they are interested in participating. 

Rachel Brandstadter
1. At the beginning of each week, go through Dr. Brandstadter’s patients for the week and make a list of patients that meet the criteria. Send this list to her via PennChart, including the patients’ names and appointment information (date and time). If any of the patients on this list indicate that they are interested in participating, Dr. Brandstadter will send you a message in PennChart with their chart. 

MS Fellows
1. MS fellows may send you messages in PennChart with additional patients that they believe may be a good fit for the study. 

***Recruitment Spiel for CRC/MS Provider Recruiting in Person***

“In this study, we’re hoping to explore the relationship between MS and depression and are interested in recruiting participants who have a MS diagnosis and who may or may not have an additional psychiatric diagnosis. If you’re interested in participating, we would ask you to complete a one-time research visit that would take around 2 to 3 hours, for which you’d receive $80. This visit can be done in-person at HUP or over Zoom. During the visit you’d complete a diagnostic clinical assessment, during which you’d be asked questions about your behaviors, mood, and medical history. You would also be asked to complete a cognitive assessment, which consists of some memory and puzzle games on the computer. We’d also ask you to authorize the research team to access your most recent clinical brain MRI scan, although this study includes no additional scanning.”

***Information to Provide to Participants***

When recruiting patients in the clinic, make sure to give them the spiel listed above, answer any additional questions that they may have about the study, and have a copy of the consent form on hand to give to them. 

***Follow-Up Time for Scheduling***

Aim to call within 24-48 hours after first initial contact with the participant. 


## Reaching out to a Participant

**Updating the Saturn Participant Recruitment Spreadsheet:**
All potential participants, along with basic contact and medical information, are recorded in an excel spreadsheet stored in Saturn. The spreadsheet filepath is: `Coordinators`-->`Protocols`-->`BALLER LAB`-->`MS_and_Depression_IRB#`-->`Participant_Recruitment`-->`MS_Dep_Call_Log.xls`. All potential participants are stored in the 'list of potential participants', and can be added to the 'Completed Visits' tab, once they have finished participating in the study. Once you have confirmed that a participant is eligible and entered the requisite information into the spreadsheet, you may reach out to them with a phone call and, if they don't answer, a text. Please be aware that you can include NO PHI in texts and voicemails to participants. You may discuss medically-specific details with a participant in the context of a recruitment call to answer questions after they have confirmed their identity. 

**Initial Recruitment:**
The IRB-approved scripts for initial recruitment and following emails are located in `MS_and_Depression_IRB#`-->`SOPs_and_Participant_Documents`-->`Recruitment_Docs` and below:


Hi, is this [Participant Name]? My name is [Coordinator Name] and I’m calling from the University of Pennsylvania. I am part of a research team working with Dr. Baller in the Department of Psychiatry. We are currently working on a study that investigates the impacts multiple sclerosis has on mood. We think you might be eligible to participate in our paid research study, and were wondering, if you have the time, whether you’d be interested in hearing more about it?

In this study, we’re hoping to explore the relationship between MS and depression, and are interested in recruiting participants who have a MS diagnosis and who may or may not have an additional psychiatric diagnosis. 

If you’re interested in participating, we would ask you to complete a one-time research visit that would take around 2 to 3 hours, for which you’d receive $80. During the visit you’d complete a diagnostic clinical assessment, during which you’d be asked questions about your behaviors and medical history, some memory and puzzle games on the computer, and complete a set of brief questionnaires that will ask you about your mood. We’d also ask you to authorize the research team to access your most recent clinical brain MRI scan, although this study includes no additional scanning.

I’m happy to answer any questions you have right now! If you don’t currently have any questions, but you think you may be interested in participating, I can send you our consent form to look over at your convenience. If at that point you have any questions or want clarification on anything, you can feel free to reach out to me whenever at this number. 

**Additional Information** 
Once the participant has indicated that they are intersted in participating in the study, make sure to confirm that they a.) have a computer with a mouse; b.) a quiet place to complete their assessments. Please inform them that we complete visits in Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, not PCAM, and that we will ask them to meet us in the [HUP lobby at 3400 Spruce St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hospital+of+the+University+of+Pennsylvania/@39.9494835,-75.1955324,17z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sHospital+of+the+University+of+Pennsylvania!3m6!1s0x89c6c65bc817ac5d:0x7f07a35094915ea1!8m2!3d39.9501477!4d-75.1938829!15sCipIb3NwaXRhbCBvZiB0aGUgVW5pdmVyc2l0eSBvZiBQZW5uc3lsdmFuaWGSAQhob3NwaXRhbOABAA!16s%2Fm%2F03by0rg?entry=ttu). This lobby has wheelchairs available if you participant requires any mobility accommodations. If the participant is interested in participating but would like some additional information, you can send them an email using the following template:

### Additional Information Email Script

Dear [Participant Name], 

Thank you so much for expressing interest in participating in our research study! We are exploring how multiple sclerosis affects patients’ mental health and mental functioning. Because the majority of research on mental health has been conducted on medically healthy people, doctors are less well-informed about treating individuals with both medical and mental illnesses. With this study, we hope to help fill that gap and work towards improving patient care. 

This study is looking for participants with MS diagnoses who may or may not have mental health difficulties. We conduct the study visits over the course of two to three hours, either in person at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania or virtually. The visit includes some puzzle like games and tests on the computer, some questionnaires, and a clinical assessment. You will be compensated $80 for completing the research study. 

I am attaching a copy of our study consent form to this email for you to look over, and you are welcome to reach out via email [insert email address here] or phone [insert phone number here] if you have any further questions. 

Thanks again for your interest and have a great rest of your day! 

Best, 

[Coordinator Name]

### Confirmation Texts and Email
Make sure to send the participant a confirmation text regarding the time and location of their appointment one week, 48 hours, and 24 hours ahead of the scheduled study visit. You will also send an email 24-48 hours (depending on time of scheduled visit) to the participant with details regarding either in-person meeting point (for in-person visits, typically the HUP lobby) or the zoom link for virtual visits. Send a map with the HUP lobby location and parking suggestions in the confirmation email.
