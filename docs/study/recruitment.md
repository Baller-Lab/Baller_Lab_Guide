# Recruiting Study Participants

Study participants are recruited from the Penn MS Center, located on the second floor Neurology Clinic in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine. Participants may be referred by their MS specialist or contacted from prior participation in PennSIVE research studies. There may also be new modes of recruitment implemented in the future. Currently (as of 11/28/23) the following IRB-approved recruitment scripts can be used in participant communication. Note that eligible participants must have had recent routine clinical imaging done at a PI-approved Penn imaging center.

Be aware that, when you schedule a participant for a visit, Dr. Baller or another clinician must be notified and agree to be on call for that two to three hour block of time. It is best to discuss on-call best practices with Dr. Baller before recruiting and to remind your on-call clinician 24 hours before the interview. 

## Recruitment Practices

**Recruiting in the MS Clinic:**
Many participants are recruited during appointments with their MS specialist in the PCAM Neurology Clinic. You can reach out to a provider, such as Dr. Schindler or Dr. Perrone, and ask whether it might be possible for you to shadow and/or recruit when they are seeing patients. We are particularly interested in younger patients with relatively recent diagnoses, and when the MS provider has a patient that they think would be a good fit, you will be invited into the clinic examination room to present the patient with a copy of the study consent form and a brief description of what the study involves. If they express interest, you can ask them if you may contact them via text in the coming days to schedule a study visit. 

**Referral from a MS Specialist/MS CRC:**
One of the MS specialists or their CRCs may reach out to you and provide a list of patients that may be a good fit for the study. You should double-check the patient's eligibility in PennChart, and if they are a good fit you can reach out and invite them to participate.

## Reaching out to a Participant

**Updating the Saturn Participant Recruitment Spreadsheet:**
All potential participants, along with basic contact and medical information, are recorded in an excel spreadsheet stored in Saturn. The spreadsheet filepath is: `Coordinators`-->`Protocols`-->`BALLER LAB`-->`MS_and_Depression_IRB#`-->`Participant_Recruitment`-->`MS_Dep_Call_Log.xls`. All potential participants are stored in the 'list of potential participants', and can be added to the 'Completed Visits' tab, once they have finished participating in the study. Once you have confirmed that a participant is eligible and entered the requisite information into the spreadsheet, you may reach out to them with a phone call and, if they don't answer, a text. Please be aware that you can include NO PHI in texts and voicemails to participants. You may discuss medically-specific details with a participant in the context of a recruitment call to answer questions after they have confirmed their identity. 

**Initial Recruitment:**
The IRB-approved scripts for initial recruitment and following emails are located in `MS_and_Depression_IRB#`-->`SOPs_and_Participant_Documents`-->`Recruitment_Docs` and below:


Hi, is this [Participant Name]? My name is [Coordinator Name] and I’m calling from the University of Pennsylvania. I am part of a research team working with Dr. Baller in the Department of Psychiatry. We are currently working on a study that investigates the impacts multiple sclerosis has on mood. We think you might be eligible to participate in our paid research study, and were wondering, if you have the time, whether you’d be interested in hearing more about it?

In this study, we’re hoping to explore the relationship between MS and depression, and are interested in recruiting participants who have a MS diagnosis and who may or may not have an additional psychiatric diagnosis. 

If you’re interested in participating, we would ask you to complete a one-time research visit that would take around 2 to 3 hours, for which you’d receive $80. During the visit you’d complete a diagnostic clinical assessment, during which you’d be asked questions about your behaviors and medical history, some memory and puzzle games on the computer, and complete a set of brief questionnaires that will ask you about your mood. We’d also ask you to authorize the research team to access your most recent clinical brain MRI scan, although this study includes no additional scanning.

I’m happy to answer any questions you have right now! If you don’t currently have any questions, but you think you may be interested in participating, I can send you our consent form to look over at your convenience. If at that point you have any questions or want clarification on anything, you can feel free to reach out to me whenever at this number. 

**Additional Information** 
Once the participant has indicated that they are intersted in participating in the study, make sure to confirm that they a.) have a computer with a mouse; b.) a quiet place to complete their assessments. Please inform them that we complete visits in Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, not PCAM, and that we will ask them to meet us in the [HUP lobby at 3400 Spruce St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hospital+of+the+University+of+Pennsylvania/@39.9494835,-75.1955324,17z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sHospital+of+the+University+of+Pennsylvania!3m6!1s0x89c6c65bc817ac5d:0x7f07a35094915ea1!8m2!3d39.9501477!4d-75.1938829!15sCipIb3NwaXRhbCBvZiB0aGUgVW5pdmVyc2l0eSBvZiBQZW5uc3lsdmFuaWGSAQhob3NwaXRhbOABAA!16s%2Fm%2F03by0rg?entry=ttu). This lobby has wheelchairs available if you participant requires any mobility accommodations. If the participant is interested in participating but would like some additional information, you can send them an email using the following template:

### Additional Information Email Script

Dear [Participant Name], 

Thank you so much for expressing interest in participating in our research study! We are exploring how multiple sclerosis affects patients’ mental health and mental functioning. Because the majority of research on mental health has been conducted on medically healthy people, doctors are less well-informed about treating individuals with both medical and mental illnesses. With this study, we hope to help fill that gap and work towards improving patient care. 

This study is looking for participants with MS diagnoses who may or may not have mental health difficulties. We conduct the study visits over the course of two to three hours, either in person at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania or virtually. The visit includes some puzzle like games and tests on the computer, some questionnaires, and a clinical assessment. You will be compensated $80 for completing the research study. 

I am attaching a copy of our study consent form to this email for you to look over, and you are welcome to reach out via email [insert email address here] or phone [insert phone number here] if you have any further questions. 

Thanks again for your interest and have a great rest of your day! 

Best, 

[Coordinator Name]

### Confirmation Texts and Email
Make sure to send the participant a confirmation text regarding the time and location of their appointment one week, 48 hours, and 24 hours ahead of the scheduled study visit. You will also send an email 24-48 hours (depending on time of scheduled visit) to the participant with details regarding either in-person meeting point (for in-person visits, typically the HUP lobby) or the zoom link for virtual visits. Send a map with the HUP lobby location and parking suggestions in the confirmation email.
