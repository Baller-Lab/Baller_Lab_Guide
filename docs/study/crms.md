# Penn CRMS
CRMS is the Clinical Research Management and Reporting System that internally tracks how many subjects have been enrolled in and completed the study. It is important to keep this record up-to-date, and patients should be linked to the study through their EPIC profile in the CRMS system once they consent to participating. More information on Penn CRMS can be found at [this website](https://www.med.upenn.edu/clinicalresearch/penncrms.html).

The CRMS portal can be accessed [here](https://pennctms.pmacs.upenn.edu/velos/jsp/ereslogin.jsp). To gain access, you will need to complete a one-time virtual synchronous training, which you can independently sign up for at this [link](https://www.myworkday.com/upenn/learning/course/9b2946e933d910019925e1be816b0000?type=9882927d138b100019b6a2df1a46018b). Please make sure to sign into your account at least once every six months, otherwise it will be automatically deactivated. Account reactivation, and other CRMS account issues, can be fixed by submitting a ticket through the CRMS system.

## Adding Research Participants to the CRMS Study
You will be adding participants to study 853883. You can enroll patients by clicking the silhouette icon at the left of the 853883 study bar on your homepage. This will take you to the `study patients` tab, where you should be able to see everyone already enrolled in the study as well as options for `patient search` and `schedule`. To add a new participant, click `patient search` and enter the patient MRN into the `patient ID` box. This should bring up the participant that has enrolled in the study. Click on their hyperlinked ID, which will bring you to their patient information and a demographics page. Navigate to the `protocols` tab once you have confirmed taht this patient is the one you are aiming to enroll. Select the IRB# `853883` in the protocol dropdown above the list of studies your patient is enrolled in at Penn, and hit the `submit` button to enroll the partiicpant in your study. You will then need to click the button `Add New Status` above the status history bar. This will open up a new window, where you will enter the status `Active/Enrolled` and then your 4-digit CRMS e-signature to save this information. The patient should now show up in the study's `study patients` tab. You can edit participant statuses and other study information further from this page once the participant is enrolled. It is importantt to keep the CRMS page up-to-date.
