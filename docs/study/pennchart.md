# PennChart (EPIC)

## Gaining Access to PennChart
You will need to complete a series of online trainings before gaining access to PennChart. PennChart (EPIC), is the secure system that the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania system uses to store information about its patients, their medical histories, test results, scheduling, and commmunication between healthcare providers. You will need to use PennChart primarily to check patients' medical and MRI histories to determine whether they are good matches for the study, although you may also need to schedule rooms in the Neurology clinic for in-person study visits.

PennChart trainings include both synchronous and asynchronous training sessions. More information on PennChart training can be found [here](https://www.med.upenn.edu/clinicalresearch/pennchart.html).  You can sign up for the sessions using the links below:

## Identifying Whether a Patient is Eligible for the Study

The study has a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria that dictate who is eligible to participate. They are as follows: 

Inclusion Criteria

1. Between 18-80 years old
2. ICD-10 MS diagnosis from one of the specialists at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center
3. Proficiency in English, as assessments and tasks are designed for English speakers
4. Able to understand study procedures and agreeing to participate by giving written consent
5. Physically and cognitively able to participate in an interview, complete a cognitive assessment, and complete questionnaires

Exclusion Criteria

1. Visual or auditory impairment severe enough to compromise task performance (as judged by the PI)
2. History of a pervasive developmental disorder
3. Subjects who are intoxicated or in withdrawal from alcohol and/or substance abuse at the time of enrollment (may be invited back at a later time)

You can determine whether the potential participant meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet exclusion criteria by reviewing their chart in PennChart(Accessible through the [PSOM portal](https://pennmedaccess.uphs.upenn.edu/vdesk/hangup.php3)). You can navigate to the chart by clicking on the `Chart Review` button in the bar at the top of the page. You can search for the patient using either their MRN or by typing in their first and last name. The `Demographics` tab in their chart will provide basic information required to register patients, including their sex, date of birth, address, and contact information. MS diagnosis can be confirmed by visiting the `Problem List` tab, but the most useful information can be gleaned from the notes and the radiology reports in the `Encounters` and `Imaging` tabs. Under `Encounters` you can view past doctor's appointments within the MS center and see who the patient's provider is. If you need additional information about the visit or want to gauge the current state of the patient's disorder, you can click on a specific office or virtual visit with a provider and read the notes. You will need to log the patient's most recent clinical MRI scan date as well as the location where their clinical scans are done. You will need to find the imaging physician order to determine where the scans were collected, which can be identified by clicking on the scan results in the `imaging` or in the `results` tab and scrolling down to the original order. You will also need to outline their MS and lesion burden history in the REDCap medical history notes collected during the study visit. This information can be found under the `Imaging` tab.
