# Paying Participants and Using Greenphire ClinCards
This study uses the Greenphire system and ClinCards to pay participants who complete the study. These ClinCards can be assigned to participants through the [Greenphire Website](https://clincard.com/login/). 

## How to assign a ClinCard
Before you can pay a participant, you will have to assign them a ClinCard. This can be done once the particpant is registered as part of the study in the Greenphire system. Once logged in to the [portal](https://clincard.com/login/), navigate to the `Register Particpant` tab. First, you will enroll the participant in `(Visa) ALL Study`. You will enter the participant's information except for their ID number, as this may differ between studies. Enrolling the participant in `ALL Study` will allow coordinators to put payments from multiple studies on one ClinCard. Then, you can register the participant in the MS/Depression study. Once the participant is registered in `ALL Study`, you will be taken to a profile page for that participant. On the right hand side of the page, select the option `Add Study` to enroll the participant in the MS/Depression study. Select the study *MS and Depression (VISA)* in the dropdown menu and enter all required information, including their BBLID. If you are assigning a virtual ClinCard, you will also have to enter the participant's email address. Once finished, click `Register` at the bottom of the page. 

Once the patient is registered in the system, you can navigate to the `Look Up Participant` tab. You can now find the participant you just registered by entering their name or BBLID into the search boxes. Click on the participant, and you will be brought to their participant profile. You can now click the button `Assign ClinCard` in the far right toolbar. You will select whether you are assigning a virtual or physical ClinCard, according to participant preference. If assigning a physical ClinCard, you will be promped to enter the token number, which can be seen through the ClinCard envelope viewing window. If assigning a virtual ClinCard, you will confirm their email address, and an activation link will be sent to the participant's email account. Once a ClinCard has been assigned, you can click the `Request Payment` link in the far right toolbar. Here you will be able to enter payment for completing the CNB ($40) and/or the GOASSESS ($40). The most participants can earn in a study visit is $80.

You should inform participants that if their card remains unused, Greenphire will take $4.50 per month off the card after 6 months from activation.

*Please note that this study does not reimburse transportation costs.*

## Virtual and Physical ClinCards
Our visa studies allows for either virtual or physical ClinCards to be assigned to participants. 

### Physical ClinCards
Physical cards look and act just like debit cards. They can be used in place of a credit or debit card when shopping or at ATMs with a valid PIN, which can be set by calling **1-866-952-3795**. This number is linked to an automated call that will ask the participant to confirm their date of birth and card number before giving you the PIN associated with that particular ClinCard. Participants occasionally have difficulty completing this step themselves, and it is okay to do the process for them as long as they consent to it and are sitting with you as you call. 

Physical cards are assigned to participants through the card's token number, which can be found in the viewing window on the envelope the card came in. Enter the token number into the Greenphire website before giving the participant their ClinCard (which should be given inside the envelope it came in). You should make a note of the token number, as once you assign the card to the participant you will no longer be able to see it. You can then add the participant's payment to the card.

### Virtual ClinCards
Participants may also receive their payment through virtual ClinCards. These are often convenient because they allow participants to deposit the payment directly into their bank accounts. They may also be used in place of a credit/debit card number for online shopping. Once you have assigned a virtual ClinCard to a particpant you can add the payment just as you would for a physical ClinCard. 

### Audit History
You can see a participants' card balance in the `Participant Information` tab. However, if you need to confirm that a payment went through or find additional details about the payment, you can navigate to the `Audit History` tab. Here you will be able to see all recent history and payments for a given participant.

## Submitting a BENHelps Ticket
The [BENHelps Support Portal](https://benhelps.upenn.edu/support/home) is where you can submit tickets to update study payment-related information, add the study to other coordinators' Greenphire accounts, and request more physical ClinCards. In the top website toolbar, click on the link for [BENHelps Request Forms](https://benhelps.upenn.edu/support/catalog/items). Select the Greenphire icon for the Greenphire Request Form. In this form you should enter all required information and a detailed note explaining exactly what you need. You should always include your Penn ID#, restate the relevant IRB #, and the ID#s of anyone you are trying to add to the study. Be sure to select the Business Administrator John Hyon from the relevant drop-down menu, and CC your PI and John Hyon and attach any relevant files before submitting. 

For establishing a new study, making budget changes, or updating C2 forms, be sure to run drafts by John Hyon and your PI before submitting the request. Detailed instructions can be found in the SOP collection on Saturn. Be sure to stay up to date on BBL SOPs. 

## Paying Participants 
Your participant must sign a W9 form and C2 form before receiving payment. It is good practice to provide them with a ClinCard FAQ sheet as well and to explain how ClinCards work. These processes can be conducted virtually (through REDCap) or, for in-person visits, with physical forms. Please refer to Saturn BBL SOPs to stay on top of BBL protocols. 

## ClinCard Reports
You will also need to complete monthly ClinCard reports for the study. Information can be downloaded from the `Reports` tab on the greenphire website. Please refer to BBL Saturn SOPs to complete these correctly. You may reach out to the Business Administrator, John Hyon, or Sage Rush with additional questions.
