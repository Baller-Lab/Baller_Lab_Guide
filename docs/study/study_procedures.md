# Study Procedures
This page outlines what a study visit should look like.

### Visit Preparation
Once the particpant has agreed to participant and has been scheduled, you can prepare for the visit. This process is covered across the other tabs--ensure that you have sent confirmation emails and texts to the participant, created BBL and Self-Report IDs through Oracle, prepared the admin for REDCap tools, prepared payment, and for in person visits, printed the necessary paperwork. 

For an in-person visit you should carry a folder containing: 

1. Study-specific C2 form
2. W9 form
3. ClinCard FAQ sheet
4. ClinCard (if using physical card)

You can also bring snacks and a water bottle from the Gates kitchenette for your participant, as the visits can be lengthy. You must also be sure that Dr. Baller is aware of when you will be conducting the visit, as she (or another clinician, if Dr. Baller is unavailable) must be on-call in case a participant endorses suicidal thoughts or behavior. 

You should also review the suicide-related self-report questions before meeting the participant. If suicidal thoughts or behavior are endorsed, you must immediately inform Dr. Baller /and the clinician on-call.

### The Participant Visit
Visits typically last 2-3 hours. The visit can be completed in the assessment rooms on the 10th floor of the Gates building or on Zoom. If you are doing your visit in Gates (which is easier to schedule), ask the participant to meet you in the HUP lobby (3400 Spruce Street). Some participants may confuse the PCAM lobby with the HUP lobby, so be prepared to use the Pavillion bridge to greet participants in either lobby in case there is a mixup. Once you have greeted the participant and introduced yourself, you can lead them to the assessment room. The study visit components should be completed in the following order:

1. Consent
2. Oracle Meds/Demos
3. Self-report in REDCap
4. CNB
5. Adaptive GOASSESS 
6. C2 form signing and payment

Once the visit has been completed, thank the participant and walk them back to the HUP lobby. 

### After the Visit
Once you have completed the visit, you should QA the interviews and make sure that the consent form and C2 are uploaded to Saturn. Any paper folders can be filed in your filing cabinet. 

Some participants may ask for feedback on their CNBs. Feedback can be obtained by making a request on behalf of the participant through the [CNB Feedback Requests](https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/request_feedback.pl). Because most participants will not understand what the reports mean, you should ask a clinician to set up a short appointment with the participant, during which the clinician will explain what the report states to the requesting participant. More instructions on how to obtain a feedback report can be found on the CNB page. 

### QA/QC Protol for After Participant Visits

After finishing a visit with a participant, you should check through the data to ensure that all the data was collected properly and accurately. 

#### 1)	Submit for CNB feedback

To submit for a CNB feedback report, you should find the participants Datasetid before starting the request. This can be found by going to webCNP.med.upenn.edu/results.pl, entering the participants BBLID in the subID box and clicking “List Session(s)”. Their Datasetid (DSI) will generate. Then, go to webcnp.med.upenn.edu/request_feedback.pl and click “New Request”, found at the top right corner of the page. Enter the participant’s Datasetid and choose Ruben Gur as the publisher. Confirm the information and then submit the request. You will receive an email when the report has been published, and it can be downloaded from the same website that it was created on. 

#### 2)	Review CNB feedback report

After the CNB report has been published, you should review the report to ensure that there are no spelling or spacing errors, and that the data results align to what you experienced during their visit. For example, if your participant took a long time on every task but the report says that speed was High Average, the data may have been collected or summarized incorrectly. If you notice a discrepancy, contact Dr. Baller, review your concerns, and she will approve you reaching out to Tarlan (cc her) to inquire about what you’ve noticed.  Once the report is finalized, save it on Saturn. 

#### 3)	Review the REDCap Self-Report Ratings

The REDCap ratings can be viewed at axis.med.upenn.edu/index.php?action=myprojects. Review the results of the self-report ratings and ensure that all questions have been answered. If a question was skipped, reach out to the participant, and clarify whether they skipped it on purpose or if it was an accident. If it was an accident, set up a brief call with them to fill in the missed questions. Once you have reviewed, save results to Saturn.

#### 4)	Review the GOA Ratings Data

The GOA ratings data can be viewed at https://phenome.med.upenn.edu. Under Admin Tools, find the Session Data section and click on “Participant lookup”. Here, enter the participants BBLID and review the GOA ratings data, paying close attention to the score under each category. Make sure each psychopathology domain has a number. 

#### 5)	Compare the GOA and REDCap Self-Report Data

After reviewing the GOA and REDCap Self-Report Data, compare the results from both to see if any differences may be present. For example, if the participant is highly symptomatic for depression in their ratings (BDI greater than or equal to 19 and PHQ-9 greater than or equal to 10), ensure that their GOA rating falls at the range of 0.7-1 if not higher. If the scores do not align, inform Dr. Baller to trouble-shoot. 

#### 6)	Check the CNB Data

Go to https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/manual.html and click on “View Data” and then “Reports & Norm Data”. Under “Battery”, select the most updated msdep_k23_v# battery, and under “Site” select MSDEP. Click “Generate data report” and a sheet should download. On this sheet, you should ensure that there aren’t any gaps in the data and that the data came out the way you were expecting. If there are any gaps or problems in the data, reach out to Dr. Baller to trouble-shoot. Be sure to include the participants BBLID and the specific issues in the data when informing Dr. Baller.
