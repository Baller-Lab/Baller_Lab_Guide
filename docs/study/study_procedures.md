# Study Procedures
This page outlines what a study visit should look like

### Visit Preparation
Once the particpant has agreed to participant and has been scheduled, you can prepare for the visit. This process is covered across the other tabs--ensure that you have sent confirmation emails and texts to the participant, created BBL and Self-Report IDs through Oracle, prepared the admin for REDCap tools, prepared payment, and for in person visits, printed the necessary paperwork. 

For an in-person visit you should carry a folder containing: 

1. Study-specific C2 form
2. W9 form
3. ClinCard FAQ sheet
4. ClinCard (if using physical card)

You can also bring snacks and a water bottle from the Gates kitchenette for your participant, as the visits can be lengthy. You must also be sure that Dr. Baller is aware of when you will be conducting the visit, as she (or another clinician, if Dr. Baller is unavailable) must be on-call in case a participant endorses suicidal thoughts or behavior. 

You should also review the suicide-related self-report questions before meeting the participant. If suicidal thoughts or behavior are endorsed, you must immediately inform Dr. Baller /and the clinician on-call.

### The Participant Visit
Visits typically last 2-3 hours. The visit can be completed in the assessment rooms on the 10th floor of the Gates building or on Zoom. If you are doing your visit in Gates (which is easier to schedule), ask the participant to meet you in the HUP lobby (3400 Spruce Street). Some participants may confuse the PCAM lobby with the HUP lobby, so be prepared to use the Pavillion bridge to greet participants in either lobby in case there is a mixup. Once you have greeted the participant and introduced yourself, you can lead them to the assessment room. The study visit components should be completed in the following order:

1. Consent
2. Oracle Meds/Demos
3. Self-report in REDCap
4. CNB
5. Adaptive GOASSESS 
6. C2 form signing and payment

Once the visit has been completed, thank the participant and walk them back to the HUP lobby. 

### After the Visit
Once you have completed the visit, you should QA the interviews and make sure that the consent form and C2 are uploaded to Saturn. Any paper folders can be filed in your filing cabinet. 

Some participants may ask for feedback on their CNBs. Feedback can be obtained by making a request on behalf of the participant through the [CNB Feedback Requests](https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/request_feedback.pl). Because most participants will not understand what the reports mean, you should ask a clinician to set up a short appointment with the participant, during which the clinician will explain what the report states to the requesting participant. More instructions on how to obtain a feedback report can be found on the CNB page.
