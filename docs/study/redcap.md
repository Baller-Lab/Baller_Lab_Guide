# REDCap Functions
We use [REDCap](https://axis.med.upenn.edu/) to collect, store, and track participant data. You will use REDCap to access:

| Study Component | REDCap Project Name |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Study consent forms | MS Depression IRB# Consent #consents |
| GOASSESS | GOASSESS #collection |
| Participant self-report scales | MS Depression Collection Scales #collection |
| Study tracker | MS Depression Tracker #tracker |

### Consent Forms
You will go through the consent form with your participant at the very beginning of every study visit. You will prepare by navigating to the MS and depression consent project on REDCap and by clicking the `Add New Record` button. You will then enter all information pertaining to the participant on the `Admin` page and the `Activities and Options` page. Once you reach the `MS Depression Consent` page, click the survey options dropdown menu at the top of the page and click `Open Survey` to open the survey in a new tab.

If you are completing the visit in person, you can now turn the screen to face the participant and walk them through the consent form. They can then type in their name and the date to complete the form. 

If you are completing the visit virutally, copy the survey link (once opened in a new tab) and paste it into the zoom chat. The participant will be able to open it on their own computer. Ask them to share their screen with you, go through the consent form together, and then ask them to sign the form. You must validate the consent and download a copy of the pdf. This pdf must be saved to the consents folder in Saturn. 

### Self Reports
Participants will complete the self-report scales during their scheduled visits. Self-report questions do ask about mood and history of suicidality, so it is important to review participant answers while they are filling out the self-report, looking specifically at the PHQ and BDI. If the participant indicates suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation, you must contact Dr. Baller and inform her of the situation. We also provide participants with a list of mental health resources 24 hours before the visit to support them if needed. You will fill out the necessary admin information for the self-reports, open the survey in a new tab, copy that link and paste it into a new tab for in-person visits or in the Zoom chat for virtual visits. For additional information, see email script under recruitment tab and stored in Saturn.

### Study Tracker
The study tracker contains questions regardign participants' medical history. You should go through this list with the participant during the visit (for additional information, consult best GOASSESS practices on Saturn or with Sage), although it is a good idea to consult their MS record in EPIC and to fill in MS-related information before the visit. You can then confirm this information with them during the interview.

### Other REDCap Functions
Virtual C2 forms are stored on a separate [pennmedicine REDCap site](https://redcap.med.upenn.edu/). You will need to be added to the C2 projects here to successfully complete virtual payemnt procedures. All pdfs should be downloaded and stored on Saturn. SOPs located on Saturn.
