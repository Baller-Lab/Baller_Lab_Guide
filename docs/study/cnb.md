# Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)

The study uses a study-specific version of the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery to collect cognitive data during participant visits. This battery, when administered, takes approximately 60-90 minutes depending on the participant, and includes 17 tasks with three in-built breaks.

1. Motor Praxis Task
2. Psychomotor Vigilance Test
3. Penn Face Memory Test
4. Penn Word Memory Test

## Accessing and Administering the CNB
You will need to complete a CNB training before you are able to access the administration site. This is currently organized by Tarlan Daryoush, and involves some readings, videos, and submitting a recording of you administering a CNB to a friend or colleague. Once you have login access, the test can be administered [here](https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/). Make sure that you are provided with access to the battery `msdep_k23_v2` and the sites `MSDEP_PR` (for practicing) and     `MSDEP` (for administering the test to participants). Implement ProcTrack as you go through the CNB to log data quality and make any notes about deviations or technical difficulties throughout the battery administration. Technical difficulties encountered during administration can be reported in the slack channel 'cnb_issues_reports' to get real-time troubleshooting help. Anything not resolved should be logged in notes.

## After the CNB
Some participants may ask for feedback on their CNB performance. Feedback can be obtained by making a request on behalf of the participant through [WebCNP](https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/results.pl). Here you will insert the participants BBLID to get their datasetID (DSI). You will then go to [CNB Feedback Requests] (https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/request_feedback.pl), insert their DSI, select Ruben Gur as the publisher, and confirm their information to create the feedback request. Once the feedback is published, you will receive an email. Because most participants will not understand what the reports mean, you will need to ask a clinician to set up a short appointment with the participant, during which the clinician will explain what the report states to the requesting participant. After confirming an appointment with both the clinician and the participant, create a feedback folder in Saturn (a.	Coordinators/protocols/baller lab/MS and Dep/participants). Within the participant folder, create a new folder with the participants BBLID as the name. In this folder, create an additional folder named "feedback_materials", and add the feedback report, the surveys, and the self-report.
