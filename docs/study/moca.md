# Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)

## Getting Certified in the MoCA
You will need to get certified in the MoCA, a short cognitive assessment that is used for detection of mild cognitive impairment. To gain access to the training, create an account on the MoCA website (https://mocacognition.com). Once an account is made, navigate to the `Training Certification` tab to pay for and begin your training. This training will last approximately one hour.

You will have to ask Dr. Baller how to pay for the MoCA training. After successfully paying for the training, you will receive an email confirmation of the purchase (sent to the email that you used to register your account). Download the email as a PDF (make sure it includes the order ID, the contact information, and the payment details that shows the last four digits of the credit card). This PDF and a PDF of the credit card charge will be necessary for reimbursement purposes, which is done on Concur. You can access Concur and create expense reports here: https://travel.procurement.upenn.edu/expense-report.

After successfully completing your training, download your certificate for your records. Navigate to the `MoCA Test` tab, find the `MoCA Full` section, and then click `Download Test` to save the MoCA Test with your badge details and to get access to a script/information sheet. Use this version of the MoCA for every participant. You should also download the images for the following tasks: Alternating Trail Making, Visuoconstructional Skills (Cube), and Naming (Animal) to use during virtual visits. 

## Administering the MoCA
You will administer the MoCA after the REDCap scales and before the CNB. Print out a physical copy of the MoCA for every participant, regardless of the visit being in-person or virtual. While administering the MoCA, use the instruction sheet that you downloaded from above as a script. 

If the visit is in-person, have the participant draw directly on the sheet you printed out. If the visit is virtual, the participant should get their own piece of paper and pencil for the required sections, and have them show their drawings to the camera to score. 

## Saving the MoCA
After your visit, you will need to scan the MoCA to save to Saturn. There is a portable scanner in Pod A in Richards that you can use. To set this up, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Go to https://epson.com/Support/Scanners/ES-Series/Epson-WorkForce-ES-50/s/SPT_B11B252201
2. Select your operating system and then click `GO`
3. Download the `Drivers and Utilities Combo Package Installer`
4. After downloading the link from above, the app will take you through the rest of the setup steps. 

MoCA's are stored in Saturn within the participants folder, in the feedback_materials folder. It should be named BBLID_moca.
