# Lab Infrastructure
The Baller Lab uses GitHub, Saturn, and the Wix lab website to keep our documentation organized, up to date, and accessible. The GitHub can be used to hold important and widely-utilized code and also hosts this webpage. This page should be kept up to date and should reflect active personnel, procedures, and expectations. 

The Saturn database is used lab-wide and contains secure information. The filepath to navigate to Baller Lab materials is `Coordinators/Protocols/BALLER LAB`.

The Wix page is publicly accessible and intended to inform patients, potential participants, students, and colleagues about the work done in the Baller Lab. It must also be kept up to date, and the `News` and `Publications` sections should be frequently updated. 

The GitHub contains all Baller Lab records of Standard Operating Practices and instructions for keeping studies and the websites up and running. As it is the source of lab practices and protocols, it must be kept up to date and updated frequently.
