# Keeping The GitHub Page Up to Date
This GitHub page is the hub of all lab protocols, procedures, and best practices. Therefore, it is important that it be kept up to date! Whenever IRB changes impact recruitment practices, platforms change, personnel change, or other protocol-impacting changes occur, they should be reflected on this site. The following steps will go over the very basics of upating this GitHub repository. 

## Updating the Baller_Lab_Guide Repository
The Baller_Lab_Guide is a repository inside the Baller_Lab organization. It contains all files that are fundamental to producing the `Just the Docs` page that you are currently reading and folders with markdown outlining all of the information in the website subpages. You will be mostly concerned with the contents of the folder `docs`. 

`docs` contains two folders: `Lab_Basics` and `study`. `Lab_Basics` contains the files outlining lab infrastructure, the Wix page, and this page. The `study` folder contains all files detailing how to execute a research visit in the Baller Lab. As the lab grows, you can add more folders and pages to meet the lab's needs. However, to do this, you will need some familiarity with GitHub and Visual Studio Code. Luckily, there are many tutorials online that will help answer any questions you have. 

### Editing GitHub Files
In order to add to this page, you will need to edit the contents of the GitHub `Baller_Lab_Guide` repository. This is easily done with Visual Stuido Code. First, you will need a GitHub account and to be added to the Baller_Lab organization (Prof. Baller will be able to do this for you). 

1. Open Visual Studio Code and GitHub, navigating to the Baller_Lab_Guide repository. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code by pressing `ctrl` + ` .
