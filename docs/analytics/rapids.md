"Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams (RAPIDS) allows you to process smartphone and wearable data to extract and create behavioral features (a.k.a. digital biomarkers), visualize mobile sensor data, and structure your analysis into reproducible workflows.

RAPIDS is open source, documented, multi-platform, modular, tested, and reproducible. At the moment, we support data streams logged by smartphones, Fitbit wearables, and Empatica wearables (the latter in collaboration with the DBDP)."
