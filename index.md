# Welcome to the Baller Lab GitHub!
This page has been designed to guide you through the basics of data collection and lab maintenance in the Baller Lab! The `Current Study` page offers detailed information about all components of MS/Depression study visits. There are also guides for navigating the many websites used by Penn researchers and basic information about updating the GitHub and lab webpage, hosted by WIX, under `Lab Basics`.

#### Lab Mission
The Baller Lab is a consultation-liaison psychiatry lab committed to improving care for patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical illnesses. Historically, most research in psychiatry has focused on studying medically healthy patients, leaving physicians with less guidance when caring for patients with complex medical needs. Our lab focuses on combining brain imaging, psychiatric evaluations, and medical informatics to better understand how physical illness impacts psychiatric health.
